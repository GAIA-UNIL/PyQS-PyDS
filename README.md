# PyQS-PyDS
Simple Python implementation of QS and DS

The purpose of this code is to provide simple and easy implementation QS (Quantile Sampling) and DS (Direct Sampling) for future development in Python. The goal is to share a code easy to understand, read and modify to do algorithmic tests.

The code is designed for a single continuous variable that is usually enough to understand the philosophy behind the algorithm.
To test the code please refer to the ```qs.py``` and ```ds.py```

The managment of categorical variable was added and can be tested using  ```qsCat.py``` and ```dsCat.py```

In any case this code should NOT be used for production OR BENCHMARKING. Please refer to [G2S](https://github.com/GAIA-UNIL/G2S) for QS and to [RandLab](http://www.randlab.org) for DS for efficient implementations.

For a similar implementation of DS in MATLAB please refer to [DS_in_Matlab](https://github.com/GAIA-UNIL/DS_in_Matlab)
